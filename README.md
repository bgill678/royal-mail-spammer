The website https://royalmail-parcel-tracking.com/ are curently sending out text messages with their name spoofed as the real Royal Mail.
Upon loading the website, it is clear that the SSL certificate is invalid due to a deceptive scan, but for some, it may not show.
It is easy to establish that the forms do not have a check looking for active numbers/card details as you can type anything in and click submit. Due to this check not being present, I am taking advantage of the HTML boxes by inputting random information, and sending it to the scammer. This should make it incredibly hard for the scammer to decipher real-fake details from users.

I am using the web driver selenium to automate the process.

This can be used for a variety of websites, or even used as a template for something bigger as a range of navigation options are available.

This requires python3+

I am currently working on spamming the active sites as seen in the recent commits
